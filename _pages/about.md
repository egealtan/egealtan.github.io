I'm Ege.

Currently, I am a Director at [AE Studio](https://ae.studio), where I lead teams developing agency-increasing products.

I've  completed my Ph.D. in Neural Engineering at Northwestern University, within Miller Limb Lab and [Neuromuscular Control Lab](https://www.sralab.org/research/labs/Neuromuscular%20Control%20Lab), where I explored how the brain orchestrates hand movements. My doctoral work was aimed at developing biomimetic brain-computer interfaces to help individuals with paralysis regain their ability to move. For more details about my work, you can view my doctoral [dissertation](https://arch.library.northwestern.edu/concern/generic_works/gf06g317d?locale=en) or my [CV](http://egealtan.github.io/files/Ege_Altan_CV_20230925.pdf).

I'm passionate about deciphering complex datasets and finding solutions to practical problems. My passion has taken me to various places. For instance, at Meta, I worked on [transforming subtle muscle signals into control commands for AR/VR platforms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kx_nVrEKwTE), contributing to the evolution of how we interact with technology and experience the digital world. 

Previously, I've also developed [bio-robotic locusts to detect explosives](https://source.wustl.edu/2020/08/researchers-one-step-closer-to-bomb-sniffing-cyborg-locusts/), exploring how biological and technological elements can work together to address real-world safety concerns.

When I'm not working, I enjoy traveling to new places, trying out new recipes, playing my electric guitar, exploring nature through hiking and bouldering, and relaxing with a good game of football (âš½).
