I am a biomedical engineering PhD student in [Miller Limb Lab](https://www.millerlimblab.com/). I am interested in improving brain computer interfaces across behaviors, contexts, and participants. This rehabilitative technology, which converts movement intent into control signals, can allow paralyzed patients to move either robotic prostheses or their native limbs. My work involves identifying brain and muscle activation patterns that result in motor behaviors of daily living, ranging from simple and stereotyped to complex and unstructured.
