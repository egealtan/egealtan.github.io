Hello! 

I'm Ege. I've recently completed my Ph.D. in Neural Engineering at Northwestern University, [Miller Limb Lab](https://www.millerlimblab.com/) and [Neuromuscular Control Lab](https://www.sralab.org/research/labs/Neuromuscular%20Control%20Lab), where I explored how the brain orchestrates hand movements. My doctoral work was aimed at developing biomimetic brain-computer interfaces to help individuals with paralysis regain their ability to move. For more details you can view my doctoral dissertation [here](https://arch.library.northwestern.edu/concern/generic_works/gf06g317d?locale=en) and my CV [here]().

I'm passionate about using machine learning tools to decipher complex datasets and to find solutions to practical problems. My passion has taken me to various places and projects. For instance, at Meta, I embraced the challenge of melding the digital and physical worlds, working on cutting-edge augmented and virtual reality technologies. My work focused on transforming subtle muscle signals into control commands for AR/VR platforms, contributing to the evolution of how we interact with technology and experience the digital world. I've also worked on projects like developing bio-robotic locusts to detect explosives, exploring how biological and technological elements can work together to address real-world safety concerns.

When I'm not working, I enjoy traveling to new places, trying out new recipes, playing my electric guitar, exploring nature through hiking and bouldering, and relaxing with a good game of European football.
